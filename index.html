            <h2>Barriers</h2>
            <h3>Finance and Travel</h3>
            <p>Due to the University of Toronto being very <span>prestigious</span> school internationally,
                naturally costs are quite high. On top of that, the St. George Campus is
                decently far from me and would require long busing and transportation times
                and costs. It will be unlikely that I will have a car at the time and finally,
                my grandmother will be alone for longer, which could be dangerous.
            </p>
            <h3>Competitiveness</h3>
            <p>Before realizing my <span>slight</span> oversight, I thought the program would
                only require high 80 marks and would be relatively safe path option for me.
                Instead, EngSci is one of the most difficult undergraduate programs in Canada,
                roughly ranking 4th. On top of that, the listed admission grade listed is low
                90's, thus supporting students with averages higher than that.

                <h2>Strategies</h2>
                <h3>Finance and Travel</h3>
                <p>The simplest method for reducing finance costs is applying for a <span>scholarship</span>. All universities
                    offer small scholarships simply for admission and larger funds for stronger applicants.
                    On top of that, continue to save money for university as I already have an account for it.
                    In regards to transportation, see if <span>carpooling</span>, obtaining my own car, or <span>reesidence</span> is an option.
                    This allows me to travel back and forth a bit faster, but still leaves the issue of my grandmother
                    being alone for longer.
                </p>
                <h3>Competitiveness</h3>
                <p>Try to build a strong portfolio and resume. Seek out <span>volunteer</span>, <span>work</span>, and <span>lab</span> experience
                    as all help reinforce many skills such as analysis, responsibility, curiosity, teamwork
                    and more. Continue to build and specialize in different extracurricular activites. Finally,
                    compete in various <span>competitions</span> that revolve around my interests. By going in depth
                    about different interests I have (related to Aerospace if possible), I can help my chances
                    to be admitted.

            <h2>Why Aerospace Engineer?</h2>
            <p>Aerospace is an industry with huge potential. The space industry (where I hope to go with this career) will be very important in the future in regards to exploration, but also in tourism.
                Aerospace is something I have been interested in for a while. I have learnt a lot about astrophysics and quantum mechanics because it is something I loved and I deemed complicated. 
                Finally, it is something that makes my parents and I happy. My mother especially wants me to go into a career and program that makes use of my intelligence. This is an area that also pleases me in the sense it is complicated, requires science and math, experimental science, and more.
